# Directed acyclic graph (DAG)

This web application can be used to create and change 
[directed acyclic graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) 
and their drawings.

Its frontend [dag.watchduck.net](http://dag.watchduck.net) uses Vue.js.<br>
Its backend [back-dag.watchduck.net/dag](http://back-dag.watchduck.net/dag/)
uses NetworkX for the graph properties and Django REST Framework for the API.
